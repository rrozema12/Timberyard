<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are lots of logging libraries out there, but they all come with using additional libraries. Timberyard has minimal dependencies and works utilizing core logging technology provided by JavaScript.

This project is still in its early stages, but it works for creating simple logs in the console. Eventually I would like to develop a way to log to a file, and a way to "ship" logs through an email to notify users when important logs occur.

### Built With
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
